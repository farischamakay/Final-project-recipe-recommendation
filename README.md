# Final-project-recipe-recommendation
This is a coding repository that I created and presented for my final project in college. This program is an implementation of a recommendation system in an Android mobile application for cookbook recipes. I created this program using the Flutter programming language, and for the backend, I used Python.

The demo for this application you can watch on my youtube :
